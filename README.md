NeutrinoAPILib
=================
This API SDK was automatically generated by APIMATIC BETA v2.0

How To Configure:
=================
The generated controller classes accept the configuration parameters in their
respective constructors.

The generated code uses a java library namely UniRest. The reference to this
library is already added as a maven dependency in the generated pom.xml
file. Therefore, you will need internet access to resolve this dependency.

How to build and install via Maven: 
=============

    1. Extract the zip file to a new folder named JavaSDK.
    2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the JavaSDK/NeutrinoAPILib folder.
    3. Execute "mvn install", this will install dependencies and also add the generated JAR in your local maven repository. 
    4. In your own maven application, add the following lines which will refer to newly installed SDK: 
        <dependency>
            <groupId>NeutrinoAPILib</groupId>
            <artifactId>NeutrinoAPILib</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>


How to build via Eclipse: 
=============

For build process do the following:

    1. Open Eclipse and use "Import" option in "File" menu.
    2. Select "General -> Existing Projects into Workspace" option from the tree list.
    3. In "Select root directory", provide path to the unzipped archive for the generated code.
    4. Click "Finish" and ensure that "Project -> Build Automatically" option is enabled in the menu.
